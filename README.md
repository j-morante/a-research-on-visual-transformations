Repository created to host the database for the Bachelor Thesis "A RESEARCH ON VISUAL TRANSFORMATIONS AS A TOOL TO SUPPORT COLOR BLINDNESS".

The database contains 125 images depicting situations from everyday life that a people suffering from CVD (Color vision deficiency) could find troublesome. Some of the themes we can find within the database are: artistic/office supplies, sports games, food, board games. However, some other pictures do not fall into any generalized category.
